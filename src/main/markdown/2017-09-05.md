## branching policy and its followup

https://discuss.lightbend.com/t/patching-strategy/1924/14

Branches are renamed to "development"

Phase 1: Get nightly to build.

## phase 2: mono nightly that's fully functioning

We want a nightly that uses sbt for nightly publishing,
while using "develop" branch from zinc, etc.

```
$ sbt -Dbuild.version=1.3.0-bin-20180903T010259 -Dsbt.util.path=../util
```

We need to make sure that Scala 2.11 etc works (This requires Zinc bridge source to be published).
Currently Jenkins retains snapshots for 6 months.

### sbt 0.13

launcher is failing to resolve sbt over HTTPS.
probably use the official zip that has JARs.

### IntelliJ: dumping sbt project structure

plugin classpath is same across the build.

If this works out, maybe it should be folded into sbt/sbt?
Justin to start conversation.
