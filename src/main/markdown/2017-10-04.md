## Agenda

- 1.0.3
- 1.1.0
- SCP-015: Improving performance and profiling of Zinc
- API (includes sbt launcher)
- packaging JAR (how the prebundled thing is packaged)

### Attendees

- Eugene Yokota @ Lightbend
- Dale Wijnand @ Lightbend
- Jorge Vicente Cantero @ Scala Center
- Justin Kaeser @ JetBrains
- Toni Cunei @ Lightbend

### 1.0.3

- Under compilation on Zinc (https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues/417)
- 2.13 compatibility for REPL
- Toni to look into sbt 1.0.2 vs 0.13.16: different test TaskDefs <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3583> `Class.forName` no longer works with the name Zinc generates for nested objects.
- Short-term fix for file watching. (Revert to old way for now)

### 1.1.0

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/milestone/24

- Slash is now merged
- LSP is also merged, and VS Code Extension is released. <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightbend.vscode-sbt-scala>
- Documentation, and potentially rewrite rule for slash
- sbt-error-summary?

### SCP-015: Improving performance and profiling of Zinc

#### Overview of SCP-010: Providing Better Compilation Performance Information

[SCP-010](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/bd32d7f38f5aeebd4c5aa0f19ab8840f543f6632/proposals/010-compiler-profiling.md)

* [scalacenter/scalac-profiling][]
* [scala/scala#6034][]: Collect all statistics and optimize checks
* [scala/scala#6051][]: Initialize statistics per global
* [scala/scala#6067][]: Add hooks, counters and refine the statistics infrastructure

[scala/scala#6034]: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6034
[scala/scala#6051]: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6051
[scala/scala#6067]: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6067
[scalacenter/scalac-profiling]: https://github.com/scalacenter/scalac-profiling

Jorge: Not much in common with SCP-015.
You add a compiler plugin that generates "profiledb", similar to semanticdb.
For example, this would be used to track implicit searches.

- global info (timers and counters)
- local info (concrete positions)

sbt plugin to warm up compiler.

#### Review the proposal

[SCP-015](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/bd32d7f38f5aeebd4c5aa0f19ab8840f543f6632/proposals/015-zinc-performance.md)

* Is there a subset of minimum requirements?
* Can we find a definition for "done"?
* What, instead, are the "nice-to-haves"?
* https://github.com/scala/compiler-benchmark/pull/30

#### Technical notes

Jorge: The plan is to create external tools to assess how well Zinc does.

1. Understanding the incremental compilers performance profile.
   Try to summarize what Zinc is doing. Users could attach this file when they file a bug.

2. Making incremental compilation faster; and,
   - Idea: Tool to run Zinc over commits on a community project, and measure results. See where class-based namehashing works/fails.

3. Allowing Scala users to optimize for faster development write-compile-test cycles.
   - Idea: Merging phases
   - Idea: Compile to JAR
   - Idea: Delay incremental compiler phases, so we can pipeline multiple compilation in parallel. This could be tricky because mutation inside Scalac like symbols.
   - Researching which aspects of the Scala programming language impact incremental compilation the most. It's about collecting data and analyzing.

Dale: Are there any interaction between info collected for Scalac and the info you are going to collect for Zinc?

Jorge: Data is more or less separated. We will not be publishing to the same profiledb.
profiledb is a protobuff file. It is append only, stored in META-INF.

#### Logistic notes

Jorge: We can release in chunks. The scheduling is up to discussion.
       Idea is to at least spend one month. The deadline is next advisory board (next January).

Dale: What part is must have?

Jorge:
- Validation can be done at the end. Materialization of the last section might be delayed.
- The nice-to-haves are in the details of each sections, but overall there aren't clear nice-to-haves.
- We will fix correctness issues as we encounter them.

Jorge: Tests will be conducted by swapping out Zinc in sbt 1 on the build, taking advantage of the modularity.

Jorge: sbt is not able to express recursiveness in task DSL. I will write up bug report, not a show stopper.

### Example code service (includes sbt launcher)

Download link in zipped example contains sbt launcher (Activator replacement).

Toni: We could potentially add feature to support IntelliJ's usage.

### packaging JAR (how the prebundled thing is packaged)

https://github.com/sbt/sbt-launcher-package
https://github.com/sbt/sbt-launcher-package/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

```
$ sbt -Dsbt.build.version=1.0.2 -Dsbt.build.offline=true
> universal:pacakgeBin
> universal:packageTarZip
> windows:packageBin

$ sbt -Dsbt.build.version=1.0.2 -Dsbt.build.offline=false
> debian:publish
> rpm:publish
```

It might be a good idea to switch to Maven style layout, now that sbt 1 is shipped in Maven Central.
