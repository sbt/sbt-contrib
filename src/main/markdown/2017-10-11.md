## Agenda

- 1.0.3
- 1.1.0

### Attendees

- Eugene Yokota @ Lightbend
- Dale Wijnand @ Lightbend
- Jorge Vicente Cantero @ Scala Center
- Justin Kaeser @ JetBrains
- Toni Cunei @ Lightbend

### Zinc

#### Quasar zinc bug (update scritped)

The Quasar undercompilation issue is fixed.
Jorge: If the scripted test is updated, it's ready.

#### release early

Release on merge.
Stable will also be published via this plugin.
Let's go forward.
If we do not put into houserules, we might break monorepo emulation.

Justin: Can sbt/sbt also be on release early?
Toni: We could use Artifactory for easier cleanup of old stuff. Bintray would keep accumulating.

### 1.0.3

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/milestone/32

- Zinc undercompilation
- Dale: not sure why #3501 is happening
- Java 9 compat #3587

Important bugs are Zinc undercompilation and Java 9.
We should cut 1.0.3 when we have those, and move on to 1.0.4 for the rest.

### 1.1.0

1.1.0 will ship based on time-boxing + bug fixes from 1.0.3.

### ~compile

Generates file.
Starts watching.
The generation of the file is triggering ~.
Maybe managed source directory should excluded.
Old base sources did one level (`*`).

### difference in testing

Found way to filter out.
"api.specification" document lost from repo.

[warn] Attempting to overwrite $destination (non-SNAPSHOT)
