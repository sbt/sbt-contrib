## 1.0.3

- Dale: Someone poked us on Quasar bug, so we should release 1.0.3
- Dale: ~ fix is already useful.
- Can Toni confirm NPE workaround by tomorrow morning? - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3519 https://github.com/sbt/librarymanagement/pull/177

- Ignore null in generic lambdas parameters: https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/419

## Test and Zinc interaction

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3583

For 1.0.3, we should filter out nested and make it 0.13 compatibile.

For 1.x, we can look into enhancing Zinc to return both human-friendly name `p1.p2.a.b` and Java friendly name `p1.p2.a$b`.

- We used to have something that worked with `Class.forName(..)` (this is called "fully qualified name").
- Human friendly Scala name is ambiguous: CCO (`a.b.c`), OOO (`a.b.c`).
- "Canonical" name resolves Java's type aliasing e.g. `Integer` vs `java.lang.Integer`. See Java spec.

## 1.1.0

- Unified slash syntax
- Basic VS Code integration
- Jorge's scripted enhancements

## 1.2.0

During the next quarter our goal is 50% sbt 1 converage on Community Build out of 120 in https://github.com/scala/community-builds/blob/2.12.x/configs/project-refs.conf

Scala Center (Guillaume) might also work on similar task.

Likely around December, 20.

- Contributor's handbook
- cleanup of test infrastructure (flaky tests, move module tests out, ...)
- Moving librarymanagement tests to sbt/librarymanagement
- More VS Code related stuff (working with Virtus)
- Better scripted that doesn't require publishLocal
- abiVersion - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3562
- Multi JAR

See https://github.com/sbt/sbt/wiki/Module-status for various module status.

## migration

- 1.0.3 is important for IntelliJ
