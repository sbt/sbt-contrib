- 1.0.4
- 1.1.0

## 1.0.3

<https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2017-10-27-sbt-1-0-3-hotfix/>
The website hasn't been updated.
sbt/website now auto deploys to scala-sbt.org
Eugene to write up website update procedure

## perf concerns

- startup slow down
- update perf
- incremental compiler (total time)
- incremental compiler (zero change)
- triggered execution (~) detection
- total build time

- Next step would be to implement benchmark scores.
- Task timing breakdown

Regressions might be tied to lack of tests.

## regressions

- `~` continues to haunt us
- testQuick
- library management (NPE)

## 1.0.4

- `~` continues to haunt us
- testQuick (we need to cherry-pick)
- release ivy / launcher / lm (Fix for JDK 9)
- Support for Scala 2.13 (https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3427)

- Moving librarymanagement tests to sbt/librarymanagement
