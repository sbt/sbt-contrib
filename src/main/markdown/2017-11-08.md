## 1.0.3

Eugene: Website is now updated.
I was close to remove Nanoc, and use Paradox. We will come back to this.

## perf concerns

- some logging perf identified (in Ivy and in general via include location)
- repro project shows 60% slow down

- startup slow down
- update perf
- incremental compiler (total time)
- incremental compiler (zero change)
- triggered execution (~) detection
- total build time

- Next step would be to implement benchmark scores.
- Task timing breakdown

Regressions might be tied to lack of tests.

## 1.0.4

Eugene released launcher 1.0.2 with Yoshida-san's Ivy patch. (for JDK 9)

- Fix for incremental compiler value class
- `~` continues to haunt us
- release ivy / launcher / lm (Fix for JDK 9)
- Support for Scala 2.13 (https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3427)
  - sbt 1.0.3 doesn't seem to compile the bridge. needs more investigation.
  - https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-sbt/compiler-bridge_2.13.0-M2/1.1.0-M1-bootstrap/

### flaky test

Toni: Odd characters can get inserted.

## 1.1.0

RC-1 once Unix domain socket is ready.

- Unified slash syntax
- Basic VS Code integration
- Jorge's scripted enhancements

potential more tasks:

- Unix domain socket (IPC socket) 2~3 day
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3621 (LSP logging)
- Jump to definition - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3660

Dale: Slash doc tweaks are done - https://github.com/sbt/website/pull/515

Slash scalafix can run on plugin code.

Slash scalafix is blocked on two issues:
- sbt fix cannot run on build code.
- sbt fix is setup for 0.13 but not for 1.0.

## 0.13.17

Scala 2.10.7 is aimed to support JDK 9.
