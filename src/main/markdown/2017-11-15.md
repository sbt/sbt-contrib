## 1.1.0

Eugene: Unix domain socket / Windows named pipe PR is in:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3742
Once it's merged we are good to go for 1.1.0-RC.
Might want to make sure we merge some fixes from 1.0.x.

## perf concerns

- Disable ivy log4j caller location calculation
https://github.com/sbt/util/pull/132
- Fix #433: Make classpath hashing more lightweight 
https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/452

## flaky tests

For some of the tests, problem is not in sbt.
Some Scala parsing code is not thread safe.

## 1.0.4

For Java 9 related fixes we should get 1.0.4 out soon.

`sbt` bash script no longer works in Cygwin.
Of the reasons might be the use of pipe and bc.
Toni to investigate.

## 1.0.x

Eugene to create branch of 2.13 compiler brdige.
