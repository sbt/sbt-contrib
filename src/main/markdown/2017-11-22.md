Let's try to ship this Friday.

Hotfix for ++ 2.13.0-M2: https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/453
This is currently blocked due to Jorge's other PRs.
Dale and Eugene are happy to migrate the pending PRs to 1.x branch if rebasing effort is the key concern.

1.x: feature release.

### 1.1.0

### 0.13.17

Scala 2.10.7 is aimed to support JDK 9.
Talk to Scala team about the new versions. Understand the extent of known bugs.

### Li Haoyi's blog post

Eugene: Let's not get defensive. First, we have to fully understand the problem statements listed in the post, and state then in our own words. Then explore the solution space etc.
