## 1.0.4

1.0.4 is now shipped.
<https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2017-11-27-sbt-1-0-4-hotfix-and-performance-fixes/>
Eugene: Good demonstration of having stable branch.

Once 1.1.0 final comes out, then we'll delete 1.0.x branch(es) and create 1.1.x.

## 1.1.0

LSP related PRs are now merged. (Unix domain socket, Go to definition, logging)

Eugene started release process across the modules.

- IO 1.1.1
- Util 1.1.0

## Nanosecond date

Ref: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3545 and https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3543

Toni: Can I include nanosecond date change?
1.1.0-RC should continue, and we could send PR to 1.0.x,
and merge it into 1.x before 1.1.0 final.

Eugene: 1.1.0 should contain all fixes in 1.0.x to avoid confusion.

## triggered execution ~ 

~ has an interesting pull request.
https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/90

## regression

- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3608
- NPE around lm. Eugene is having difficult time reproducing these. Potentially latency from proxy is masking the problem?

## migration

We want to have 60 community build projects on sbt 1.

We can follow what we did for sbt plugins. Make wiki page sorted by GitHub stars,
and start converting some, and encourage others to participate.

Dale to work on tuple rewrite.
