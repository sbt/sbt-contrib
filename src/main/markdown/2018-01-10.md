### 1.1.0

It's been week. It's been mostly working.
There was Windows script issue so Eugene re-released 1.1.0.1.

### 0.13.17

Currently RC-1.
We can release RC-2 soon.

### 1.2 roadmap

CI / testing things / contributor guide
dependency management testing
Java 9 (forked compilation / run / testing)
Java 18 situation?
some contraption to shorten change-sbt-try-build loop (sbtOn)

### cross Java buidling/testing

Eugene: We can pick JDK 8 or 9 as the base JDK for the build, and fork for future JDK n on either compile task or test.

Dale: If you're interested in JDK 9, then use JDK 9.

### 1.x migration

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/wiki/library-sbt-1.x-migration

Libraries are organically migrating. Currently around 30~40%?
Scalafix rule for slash syntax would still be useful

### Extracted#append

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3865

Dale: append discards setting that was appended previously by `set` command.
Since we are changing the runtime behavior, we should pick another method name.

### ~ situation

Dale to review https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3790
Also consider adopting Greg's stuff.
