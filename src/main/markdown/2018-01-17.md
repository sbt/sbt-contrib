Bar is an object

### 0.13.17

released 0.13.17-RC2.

### 1.2 roadmap

Mention possible areas of contributions.
- e.g. Coursier

Document "Note to potential contributors" process.
1. Location of source.
2. How do I test this, or mechanically reproduce failure.

We want to review previous survey, and conduct another feedback survey on Contributors.

### 1.x migration

Toni: Adding to sbt community build (10 ~ 12)

### kicking out lm scritped tests

lm hardly changes, but scripted takes really long time.

Eugene: If we bring in sbt into lm's scrited, we can bring in lm scripted test as is.
Dale: "scriptedQuick" like feature where scripted only runs for changed code might save time.
Dale: Running scripted out of target might speed things up.

Benefit Eugene wants:
1. PR validation on lm catches bugs.
2. PR validation on sbt/sbt finishes quicker.

Potential idea: manually run lm test in Travis or Jenkins.
