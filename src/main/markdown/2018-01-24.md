### Timeout during community build on sbt 1

Toni: Bumping up dependencies on Akka to track down timeouts.

### 0.13.17

The release date is 2018-01-31.

### 1.1.1

- "Modified name" fix by Jorge - https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/484
- Windows fix by Toni - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/120
- File not found exception alignment by j-keck - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/121
- FreeBSD timestamp fix by Toni - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/124
- Avoid deadlocks on spotty connections by OlegYch - https://github.com/sbt/librarymanagement/pull/204
- Tab completion when running `sbt console` by Eugene - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3876

### Copy file situation

https://github.com/sbt/io/issues/125 looks invalid, but copyFile not copying over the file permission attributes seems not ideal. This could be fixed using NIO, maybe?
Open issue about it?

### 1.2 roadmap

Make it easy to contribute. Let's make quantifiable/observable success criteria.

- Contributor's handbook (how to build from source, and run tests, etc)
- Reduction of CI time by 50%
- Measure flakiness, but test on Windows
- Ask at the end of contribution for feedback
- Make a page for Good First Issue

sbt/sbt-contrib should be used to track issues around contributions (CI is broken etc) or issues around sbt as project.

Measure more things

- Disabled test
- Turnaround time
- etc

### Java 9 / Java 10 related tasks

TBD

### server testing

Eugene is trying to fork sbt off into another thread or process, so client-server interaction can be tested using normal unit tests.

Dale: There's a usage of new File(".") that might be the reason why active.json doesn't get created.

### 1.x migration

ScalaFix change is still on table.

45 libraries are upgraded to sbt 1 according to https://github.com/sbt/sbt/wiki/library-sbt-1.x-migration
15 more libraries to go until 60, and then we should consider EOLing 0.13.

### LM testing

1. Keep dependency-management scripted tests in sbt/sbt, but don't execute it during normal CI.
2. Copy dependency-management scritped tests to sbt/lm so PR validation catches most of lm issues.
3. When lm bumps in sbt/sbt, trigger scripted test for dependency-management using Travis CI trick.

Dale is working on scripted that won't rely on publishLocal.
That could replace step 2 in the above proposal:

2B: In LM PR validation, run Jenkins job validator that runs dependency-management scripted tests.

Toni can also look into running scripted as-is on sbt/sbt.
