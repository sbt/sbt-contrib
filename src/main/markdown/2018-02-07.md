### stickers

Some ppl are receiving them now.
Probably I will switch to giving them away in conferences.

### 0.13.17

sbt 0.13.17 was released.
Likely the last of 0.13 maintanance.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v0.13.17

### 1.1.1

What's holding up 1.1.1?
Let's merge pending PRs today, and release it.

- "Modified name" fix by Jorge - https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/484
- Windows fix by Toni - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/120
- File not found exception alignment by j-keck - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/121
- FreeBSD timestamp fix by Toni - https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/124
- Avoid deadlocks on spotty connections by OlegYch - https://github.com/sbt/librarymanagement/pull/204
- Tab completion when running `sbt console` by Eugene - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3876

### 1.2 roadmap

- https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-02-01-sbt-1.2-roadmap/
- https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/request-for-feedback-sbt-1-2-0-roadmap/1552

The timeline we cannot avoid is JDK dates. Hopefully JDK 10 adoption is going to be fairly straightforward.
We should run some nightly and/or PR validations around JDK 9 and 10.
A good candidate would be https://github.com/sbt/sbt-launcher-package
See also https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/.travis.yml

Per performance regressions, we should set up benchmarks and document performance tooling in the contributor guide.

### Windows

Also in https://github.com/sbt/sbt-launcher-package.
Let's make sure this is tested.

Also backport Eugene's server testing to 1.1.x.

### 1.x migration / Dbuild timeouts

Dbuild timeout:
timeout was calculated from the beginning of extraction etc. sbt 1.x community build is too parallel because we don't need inter-library dependencies. This causes timeouts.

### LM testing / scripted

Running scripted from target is done.
It sped up by 20% for the whole suite of scripted.
`scriptedUnpublished` (This can skip publishLocal)

Can Dbuild run scripte for sbt/sbt?
Toni: It used to be able to with workaround. publishLocal is publishing in relocated "local" but Dbuild doesn't look in there. The workaround was to add a resolver to the fake "local".

### Java 9

See above. More tests needed.

### SourcePosition macro creator

sbt/util#145

This is a macro to generate position for setting definition site.
This came up during the implementation of buildinfo `<<=`/`DefinableSetting#set` call,
which takes position.

### sbt-buildinfo avoid out-of-graph execution

buildInfoKeys in Test := BuildInfoKey.fromKeys(name, fullClasspath in Compile)

### Add sbt.boot.lock sysprop to opt-out
