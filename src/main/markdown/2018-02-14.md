### Attenddees

- Toni Cunei @ Lightbend

### contrib

Podcast coming up. It would be good to start working on contrib guide.
good first issues are key.
Ask community to find good first issue.

### JDK 10

bc to expr switch broke JDK 10.
There's a request for re-release of 0.13.7 with the fix.

- Let's add test on JDK 10 on Travis
- launch package doesn't really require re-release for 0.13 since sbt 1.1.2 can launch 0.13.

### sbt 1.1.1

sbt 1.1.1 was released.
https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-02-08-sbt-1-1-1-hotfix/

When Eugene releases Debian, Bintray doesn't seem to sign the Package file any more, so he has to manually issue API call.

### 1.2 roadmap

- https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-02-01-sbt-1.2-roadmap/
- https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/request-for-feedback-sbt-1-2-0-roadmap/1552

The timeline we cannot avoid is JDK dates. Hopefully JDK 10 adoption is going to be fairly straightforward.
We should run some nightly and/or PR validations around JDK 9 and 10.
A good candidate would be https://github.com/sbt/sbt-launcher-package
See also https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/.travis.yml

Per performance regressions, we should set up benchmarks and document performance tooling in the contributor guide.

### documentation

- Eugene: learning curve is the biggest problem. a few videos and some working examples.
- Eugene: getting started guide could simplify a bit. kata like command lists.
- Dale: search could help

### nightly

Could we do some tasks asynchronously during nightly build (e.g. Jason and scala/scala perf)?
An example Dale brought up was potentially deffering MiMa/header/format changes for contributions.

Dale: Should we make nightly builds available for local use?
Toni: currently they are not published because Bintray is not cleaned up automatically.
Eugene: There's 1TB limit we should not hit.

1. Figure out remaining available space on Bintray.
2. Find out often we need to clean up the SNAPSHOTs.

alternatives are a8 server or Sonatype
snapshot example https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/dbunit/dbunit/2.6.0-SNAPSHOT/

### sbt-buildinfo

https://github.com/sbt/sbt-buildinfo/pull/114
We can get that out soon.

### Dbuild timeout issue

Fixed

### Windows
