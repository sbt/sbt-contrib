### Dale fixing copy generation in contraband and sbt/lm, and private constructor elision

```scala
// manual code
abstract class ArtifactExtra {
  def withShouldForce(..)

  def force() = withShouldForce(true)
}

// generate code
final class Artifact(name: String, version: String, shouldForce: Boolean) extends ArtifactExtra {
  private[this] def copy(...) = ...

  def withShouldForce(..) = ...
}
```

*v1*
```scala
class Foo private (x: Int)
object Foo {
  def apply(x: Int): Foo = new Foo(x)
}
```

*v2*
```scala
class Foo private (x: Int, y: Int) {
  private this(x: Int) = new Foo(x, 0)
}

object Foo {
  def apply(x: Int): Foo = new Foo(x)
  def apply(x: Int, y: Int): Foo = new Foo(x, y)
}
```
