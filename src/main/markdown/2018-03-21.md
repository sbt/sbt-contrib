### sbt/io make delete faster using an NIO file walker

https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/135

Toni describes how he's maintained semantics (outside of extreme edge cases where the new NIO impl will throw an
exception where the old impl would "happily" ignore, e.g weird permissions issues)

Dale merged into 1.x.

### retrofit-testing and optimizing scope delegation

PR from Johannes: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3979

PR from Eugene for a minimal change to optimize: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4003

PR from Dale with another take on "minimal": https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4029

Jason suggests a custom build of sbt that asserts (at runtime) that the old and new impls return the same value,
and running it against real world builds. Dale to do so.

### scala Equiv & Ordering

Dale spent some time trying to understand the implications of having an `Ordering` (and thus an `Equiv`) in
implicit scope, with regards to equals (for the `VersionNumber` sbt/lm PR).

Sent a Scaladoc cleanup PR to scala/scala: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6437
