### sbt 1.1.2

it's out

seems all good, but Bintray's outage affected us

### sbt 1.2 next steps

performance target: automation, server, talk to Scala Team

2 more weeks before ScalaSphere: let's get the contribution tasks done by then

### sbt 1.x nightly build is broken

Toni to open an issue in https://github.com/sbt/sbt-standalone-build/issues

### experiment with logging tweaks for performance

Eugene made a change to increase ivy debug logging.
And that might be the cause of GB of persisted logs (in /tmp)

perhaps let's revert the inclusion of ivy debug logging (push it to a sys prop)
perhaps let's kill `last` and not persist logs at all??
