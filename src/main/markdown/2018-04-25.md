### ScalaSphere

Dale and Eugene gave a talk on sbt 1.

### sbt 0.13

It might be good to decide end of release.
This might be a good opportunity to start triaging old bugs.

### sbt 1.1.x JLine + console bug

Eugene is looking into `console`.
sbt 1.1.3 + Scala 2.12.4: `console` doesn't display anything.
sbt 1.1.4 + Scala 2.12.5: running `console` twice disables JLine.
The suggested fix for the latter is identical to 1.1.3.

Potentially related to Zinc build bug.
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6478

### sbt 1.1.x

- Watch improvements https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/142
- Dotty plugin support

### sbt 1.2.0-M1

Let's get 1.2.0-M1 out soon.
We should review open server issues reported by Scala Center/meta guys.

### Contributing update
Support.md split

### Nightly from Jenkins

Use sbt validator.

### Optimistic Merge

We should start merging to wip branch,
and do stupid modification ourselves.
