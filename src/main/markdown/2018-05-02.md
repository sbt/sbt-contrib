### sbt 0.13

TBA around Scala Days.

### sbt 1.1.x

- Watch improvements https://github.com/sbt/io/pull/142
- Dotty plugin support
- Validator is currently not working (see below)

### Dbuild

There are two issues around Dbuild.

- sbt source tree in 1.1.x was changed, so it will start testing nightlies correctly.
- There's dependency from Zinc (test) to sbt completion. This is for Bloop support, which we should support if possible.

Hopefully everything would get up and running soon.

### sbt 1.2.0-M1

Let's get 1.2.0-M1 out soon.
We should review open server issues reported by Scala Center/meta guys.
