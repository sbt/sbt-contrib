### sbt 1.1.x

sbt 1.1.5 is on Maven Central.
One of the major changes is watcher improvements by Eathan Atkins.

### Dbuild

There were two issues around Dbuild.

- sbt source tree in 1.1.x was changed, so it will start testing nightlies correctly.
- There's dependency from Zinc (test) to sbt completion. This is for Bloop support, which we should support if possible.

These are now resolved. But we are seeing new issues with nightly:

```
[sbt212-io] [info] PollingWatchServiceSpec:
[sbt212-io] [info] - should log triggered files *** FAILED ***
[sbt212-io] [info]   triggered was false (SourceModificationWatchSpec.scala:345)
```

```
Eval.scala:547:14: object JavaMilli is not a member of package sbt.io
[sbt212] [error]       sbt.io.JavaMilli.getModifiedTime(f.getPath)
```

We will track them in GitHub https://github.com/sbt/sbt-standalone-build, which will be renamed to sbt-validator.

### sbt 1.2.0-M1

Let's get 1.2.0-M1 out soon.
We should review open server issues reported by Scala Center/meta guys.

### Java Homes

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4139
jabba problem seems to be resolved now.
Concern remains about adding JavaVersion, since that would make it more difficult to append javaHomes in global setting.

### Optimistic merge

Example:
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4126 and https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4129

Not exactly "merge" but if the PR is useful, we should do the cleanup/followup rather than forcing more work on contributors.
