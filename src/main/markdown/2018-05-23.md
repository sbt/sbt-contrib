### Scala Days Berlin + Scala Spree

both went well.
lots of involvement, lots of PRs
preparation was key, labeling + source code linking
good signaling to attract contributors
have things prepared instead of "work on whatever you want"
talk went better than ScalaSphere
overhaul is a cool story
contributors summit went ok
blog post on how to get more contributors, based on Mozilla post, e.g 24 hour review

# Loading plugins on startup, with Justin

Eugene says: just introduce additional global dirs?
Justin's use case: introduce a plugin at startup, persists across reloads, from launching sbt within IJ
Metals' use case: if it's the editor plugin use case, it's the same as Justin's
Justin's workaround is: write idea.sbt, gated by sys property
however it suffers weird bugs, such as https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3443
fixing that would unblock Justin
but he'd love to avoid writing in user's global

# Getting Involved in sbt dev, with Lukasz (4116 - reload perf)

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4116 - good instructiosn
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4009 - instructiosn not verbose enough
