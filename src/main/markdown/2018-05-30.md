### Scala Spree + sbt 1.1.6

- https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-05-29-berlin-scala-spree-and-sbt-1-1-6/

Make sure we have sbt tags + release notes.

### sbt validation

https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/issues
Toni fixed https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4175

Pending:
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/issues/24
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/issues/25
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/issues/26

### sbt 1.1.x

1.1.6 is out.
Unless it's a serious bug, maybe we should not merge too many things into 1.1.x series,
and try to get 1.2.0 sooner.

### nightlies

1. How do get them out?
2. How can people use the latest dynamically?

Push one out to Bintray every Monday?
"latest.integration"
"1.+"
"-Dsbt.version=1.+"

sbt's current built-in resolvers:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/blob/1.x/launch/src/main/input_resources/sbt/sbt.boot.properties

### sbt 1.2.0-M1

Let's try get this out soon.

## Loading plugins on startup, with Justin

Eugene says: just introduce additional global dirs?
Justin's use case: introduce a plugin at startup, persists across reloads, from launching sbt within IJ
Metals' use case: if it's the editor plugin use case, it's the same as Justin's
Justin's workaround is: write idea.sbt, gated by sys property
however it suffers weird bugs, such as https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3443
fixing that would unblock Justin
but he'd love to avoid writing in user's global

Dale: Why not just put these plugins in global?
Eugene: The use of IntelliJ or other editors could be spectrum, and you don't want them on all the time.

parameters we are trying to optimize:
- repeated startup caching.
- startup speed. (set and apply require reloading, so they are slow)
- conditional injection of settings and tasks (and plugins)

## spacial representation of cross building (build matrix)
There are multiple Scala versions (2.10, ... 2.12, 2.13.0-M4); and multiple platforms (JVM, JS, and Native); and library dependencies that partially support the combination.

problem: it's difficult to configure this in sbt, and define sane publishing or testing steps.

potential solution: use subprojects!

```scala
lazy val pipers = project.dependsOn(instruments_2_11).settings(scalaVersion := "2.11.8")
lazy val drummers = project.dependsOn(instruments_2_12).settings(scalaVersion := "2.12.1")

lazy val instruments = project.cross
lazy val instruments_2_11 = instruments("2.11.8")
lazy val instruments_2_12 = instruments("2.12.1")
```

## various pull requests

#### Fix compile clean - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3678 
Let's contact Alexey and ask him to change the imple to use configuration (e.g. Compile/clean)

See also https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/6256#issuecomment-366142058
Eugene is up for coffee + and fix myself.

#### JDK cross testing

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4139

Dale: Introduce sbt.version as if branching?
