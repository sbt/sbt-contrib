### Scala Spree

Scala Spree will be hosted by Tapad in New York.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/labels/good%20first%20issue

### sbt validation

1.x is broken.
1.1.x is fine.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/issues

### sbt 1.1.x

Unless it's a serious bug, maybe we should not merge too many things into 1.1.x series,
and try to get 1.2.0 sooner.

### nightlies

1. How do get them out?
2. How can people use the latest dynamically?

Push one out to Bintray every Monday?
"latest.integration"

"-Dsbt.version=1.+"

### sbt 1.2.0-M1

Let's try get this out soon.

## Loading plugins on startup, with Justin

parameters we are trying to optimize:
- repeated startup caching.
- startup speed. (set and apply require reloading, so they are slow)
- conditional injection of settings and tasks (and plugins)
