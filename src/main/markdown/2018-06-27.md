### sbt 1.2.0-M1

1.2.0-M1 was quietly released before Scala Days NY.
1. Eugene messed up the release so it won't work on Travis.
2. AppVeyor started failing, likely due to IO.delete issues.
3. Release notes are pending.

### Thin client

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4227

### sbt 1.2.0-RC1

I think we are ready for RC1.

### Spree status

Lots of interesting contributions. They are all merged at this point.

### Zinc bug (javac error)

`javaHome := Some(...)` makes Java compilation to be forked to commandline javac.
There's likely a parsing problem. Still waiting for more info to reproduce.

### Testing failures

LogExchangeSpec might be failing during bootstrap compilation.

### Lausanne is unreachable by network
so Jenkins are down.
