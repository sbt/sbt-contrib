### sbt 1.3.0

- what do we need before 1.3.0 phase begins
- what should be included in sbt 1.3.0

### Scalafix

Unified slash syntax is good, but it's now widely rolled out.
If we can use Scalafix.

There was an idea we discussed with Olafur of transforming build.sbt files into plain Scala files.

### when should we think about sbt 2.0?

Dale: We should start to think about what goes into 2.0,
and parepare for it.

how often should we release major version that requires ecosystem rebuild.

- Eugene: Generally we should avoid burning down the ecosystem.
- Dale: Doing to too infrequently makes the migration more painful.
- 18 months? coincide with Scala?

There has to be something interesting done in the period to qualify for a major breakage.

### welcome Muuki


### idea: classpath for plugins

Dale: potentially plugins could have their own classpath.

How would returning values from `compile.value` work?

For example, Jawn has changes its API.

We can take a hybrid approach where internal library usages are hidden but types are exposed publicly.

### idea: shading

Shading can solve internal use of libraries.
Each plugins can still expose case class or pseudo case class.

Currently public API and internal implementation are both public.
We can use either shading or classpath tricks.

### idea: TaskInternal config

Inside plugin's build.sbt:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.example" %% "protobuf" % "1.2" % TaskInternal
```

Tasks eventually run as thread executor, and it can have its own classpath.

### idea: Olafur's fat jar thing

sbt itself becomes fat JAR.

### idea: automated releases

Having automated releases for regular RC-x would be good.

### idea: un-modularization
