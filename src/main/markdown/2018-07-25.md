### Maven Central / Bintray TLS vs Java 6

To be discussed later.


### Using real `sbt` bash script

https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9816
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4282

See https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt/builds/406624685
That failure was likely due to Bintray.
Unisom may be going through something else?

Wait and see if the problem persists in wider community.

## Licensing

https://discuss.lightbend.com/t/moving-sbt-and-zinc-to-the-apache-v2-license/1670
Then we should include LICENSE file in our zip distribution.

## sbt 1.3 idea about shell

```
bbala  logging

----
> :foo/Compile/compile [10s]
> :bar/update [3s] =====>
> IDLE
```

## (optional) sbt 1.3: dependency locking

Make JSON file out of dependency graph.
Everyone who checks the build uses that the lock file to resolve instead of running Ivy.

## (optional) sbt 1.3 detection of bad settings

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/3227

## BSP support for sbt

Let's iterate using plugin.
See extensible sbt server.
