## Agenda

- sbt 1.2.0
- followup to 1.2.0
- pull request situation (0.13)
- more ideas around 1.3


## sbt 1.2.0

https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-07-02-sbt-1-2-0/

### Dbuild 

Dbuild no longer works with sbt 1.2.0.
sbt.internal package is excluded out of Mima checking.
It might be good to keep bincompat for internal where possible.

### Regression around slash syntax warning with config

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4293
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4231

```
[warn] The project ProjectRef(uri("file:/Users/eed3si9n/work/akka/"), "akka-actor-typed") references an unknown configuration "multi-jvm" and was guessed to be "Multi-jvm".
[warn] This configuration should be explicitly added to the project.
```

web-asset vs Asset.

```
lazy val ParadoxTheme = config("paradox-theme").hide
```

Suggestion revert the original PR and do something better.

In shell:

```
foo/MultiJVM/compile
```

Currently "MultiJVM" is looked up specific to the subproject "foo" in KeyIndex. But we should just scan every subproject when "foo" does not define MultiJVM.

https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/project/Formatting.scala

```
  lazy val formatSettings = Seq(
    ScalariformKeys.preferences := setPreferences(ScalariformKeys.preferences.value),
    ScalariformKeys.preferences in Compile := setPreferences(ScalariformKeys.preferences.value),
    ScalariformKeys.preferences in Test := setPreferences(ScalariformKeys.preferences.value),
    ScalariformKeys.preferences in MultiJvm := setPreferences(ScalariformKeys.preferences.value)
  )
```

## building sbt 0.13 using JDK 8

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4294

### Nudging users to use the latest patch?

Currently there's a warning to "reboot" if -sbt-version is passed. This is probably wrong:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4291
IntelliJ needs to use the latest patch releases to inject plugin.

## sbt 1.3 ideas

### abiVersion

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3562

It might be lower hanging fruit.

### changing the Ivy semantics

Someone commented out force() check.
This could add a flag to remove emulated Maven (nearest-wins) semantics.

### better shell: status

```
compile

> foo/update [10s]
> idle
> idle
> idle
```

- http://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/screen_10.html

We need to make sure the existing tasks and plugins work.

Provide status via server, and IntelliJ etc could display this natively as well.
