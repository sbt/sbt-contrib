## office hours

This meeting can be used as office hour, but you can use discuss instance:

## JDK 11

- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4389
Zinc likely is where things need fixing.

## sbt 1.2.x

https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-10-08-sbt-1-2-4-and-nightly-builds/

## nightly

repo.scala-sbt.org/maven-snapshots used to go to Bintray.
Now it goes to Jenkins.
It's using Dbuild to grab develop branch.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt-validator/

```
sbt.version=1.3.0-bin-blabla
```

sbt -Dsbt.version=....

## "super shell"

Let's collect issues before 1.3.0.
scripted and supershell issues?
`-Dsbt.progress=never` to turn off super shell.
`-Dsbt.color=never`
which spelling wins? maybe display warning.

## lm testing

scripted test infrastructure in lm to drive sbt with freshly baked lm (+ coursier).

## UpdateReport persistence

Area of big pay off.
loading and compiling both need to deserialize huge JSON file today.
Potential idea is to cache one layer above, like externalDependencyClasspath; or split JSON in two parts.

Cached update task uses disk to check hash change.
Maybe this should be in memory.

## lockfile (gem lock)

That could mitigate slowness of resolution.

## IO profiling

## server

Trying to fix flaky server test.

## IO change

macOS and Linux changes the way directory listing is done.
