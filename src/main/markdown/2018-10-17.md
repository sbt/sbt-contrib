## sbt 1.2.6 is out

https://developer.lightbend.com/blog/2018-10-17-sbt-1-2-6/

## Jenkins / nightlies

flaky test on ServerSpec (90s timeout for completion on some tasks).
Passes fine on Travis CI.

Dbuild now supports exclusion of subproject, but in a more relaxed way,
so it works on sbt 1.2.x branch and develop branch.

Toni and Andrea to have meeting.

```

## lm testing

1. get the infrastructure working.
2. identify bugs/repro steps.
3. fix them.

Plugins are not picked up.

General acceptance test is sbt/sbt scripted tests.
But we can merge once it has the basic features.
We can let the user opt-in using a setting like dependencyResolution per build or globally.

## open PR

- https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/607

## release cycle

sbt 1.1.0 came out on January 5, 2018
sbt 1.2.0 came out on July 31, 2018
For 1.x we go through RC cycle. (roughly 3 ~ 6weeks? of branch with bug patches only)
Let's shoot for January 1, 2019 as final date, and December 1st, 2018 for RC-1.

## super shell

Might need more testing locally.

## launcher

Dependency resolution of sbt itself is slow.
That needs to be fixed in launcher.
Maybe we should look into Olafur's fat jar idea.
