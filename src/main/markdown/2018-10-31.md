## Agenda

- sbt-big progress
- Coursier progress
- Scala 2.13

### sbt-big progress

Andrea is working on this.
The idea is to use assembly JAR for sbt.
It also adds shading to some libraries.
We might need to test if shading breaks things using community build.

https://github.com/sbt/launcher/pull/61

project/build.properties:

```
sbt.name=sbt-big
```

### Coursier progress

Andrea is working on this.

"Add Coursier as a library management implementation" - https://github.com/sbt/librarymanagement/pull/270
There's is lm 1.3.0-M1 with this change.

Eugene ran Travis CI to check sbt/sbt's dependency-management scripted tests
https://travis-ci.org/eed3si9n/sbt/builds/448039304
currently failing 70% of the tests:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4430#issuecomment-434103506

There's a hidden dependency relationship between publish and update.
Publish requires `ivy.xml` to be created by `update` as side effect.
There's a code in sbt-coursier to handle `ivy.xml` generation, so we need to borrow more code from there.

### Scala 2.13

- Get Zinc to use 2.13.0-M5 for compiler bridge (https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/607)
- Layered classloader issue. This create issue for Serialization Proxy pattern https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/89 (see also https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/562#issuecomment-427545324)

### JDK 11

Let's get all tests to pass.
