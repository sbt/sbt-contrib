### sbt 0.13.18

Justin wants sbt 0.13.18 released for his contrib on add plugin feature.
Let's get it out this week.

### sbt 0.13

sbt 0.13 is officially sunset.
https://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/index.html

### sbt-big

sbt-big solves two problems:
1. slow fresh startup because of resolving too many JARs.
2. sbt's library leaking out. (Jawn etc)

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4431
This the more conservative shading, Eugene is open for calling sbt-big the "sbt" artifact, and calling the traditional one something else.

The workaround:

```
sbt.name=sbt-something
```

Todo:
- run it on Community Build?
- Metabuild needs to exclude "sbt" and/or "sbt-big" (https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4437)
 
### Coursier progress

Pending task is emulating `ivy.xml` generation, which is needed by publishing.

- https://github.com/andreaTP/sbt/tree/fixingPublishingWithCoursier
- https://github.com/andreaTP/librarymanagement/tree/addingCoursierIvyXml

We could either keep using Ivy for publishing (and faking ivy.xml)
or implement Ivy-free publishing using Coursier or otherwise.
Then, an interesting qestion that arises is the notion of "local", which is 
actually an Ivy repository.
Do we keep using "local" repo?

In general, `update` and `publish` (pom.xml) should always be consistent.

### Scala 2.13
