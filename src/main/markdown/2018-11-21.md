## Agenda

- sbt 0.13
- sbt-big
- lm Coursier
- classloader
- JDK 11
- sbt 1.3.x

### sbt 0.13

sbt 0.13 is officially sunset.
https://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/index.html
Eugene tried to publish 0.13.18, but failed because JDK6 no longer works with HTTPS protocol required by Sonatype.
So the workaround is to cache JARs in packageBin task.

### sbt-big

see https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4183
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4431 is now merged.

- ivy.xml needs to be post processed so publishLocal works.
- We need to add back the libraryDependencies that we are not shading.
- Flip the default to big by renaming "sbt-big" to "sbt", and "sbt" to something else.
- Publish X1, and test it on Community Build.

Currently it takes 120s to do fresh resolution of sbt mothership.
sbt-big is projected to speed it up to 20~30s.
Adding back library dependencies might add 10s on top.

### lm Coursier

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4430

> FYI, I'm currently refactoring sbt-coursier so that:
>
> - it offers a module with implementations for sbt/librarymanagement,
> - it offers an sbt plugin, sbt-lm-coursier, setting dependencyResolution, that should be compatible almost as-is with the current sbt-coursier, passing the scripted tests of sbt-coursier too,
> - if possible, sbt-lm-coursier should shade coursier itself.

Pending task is emulating `ivy.xml` generation, which is needed by publishing.

### Classloader

1. Ethan is building multi-layered classloader to avoid reloading dependency classpath. Initial benchmark shows akka test running in 72ms vs 600ms. The win would likely be a constant one for loading and JITing the library classes.
2. On the other hand, for Scala 2.13 + Java serialization, there's a demand for flat classloader.

Probably default to slow-but-safe, but advertise fast-and-furious option too.

### JDK 11

Yoshida-san has a pending PR with failing tests: https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/602
Tooling team likely should focus on getting this hammered out for sbt 1.3.0.

### sbt 1.2.7

after upgrading to 1.2.6: `A fatal error happened in `SameAPI`: different extra api hashes for no traits!`
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4441

### sbt 1.3.0 milestone
