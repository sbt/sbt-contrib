## Agenda

- sbt 0.13.18
- lm Coursier
- classloader
- JDK
- sbt 1.3.x

### sbt 0.13.18 is almost out

Eugene has given up on publishing sbt 0.13 using JDK 1.6,
so sbt 0.13.18 is published using JDK 8.

### lm Coursier

No progress from our side.
But hopefully this is close.

### Classloader

Ethan is working on multi-layered classloader.
Currently -SNAPSHOT libraries are given its own layer.
This is up for later debate/discussion.

When we can we should try calling close().

### JDK

AdoptOpenJDK 8 - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4467

### nightly

- ScalaTest version changed from 2.13.0-M2 to 2.13.0-M5.
- Twisted dependencies on log4j 2.8.1 vs 2.11 causes missing reflection.
Toni to send a PR on this.

### sbt 1.3.0 milestone

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/milestone/45

### watch vs sources for tasks

Ethan is thinking about creating a setting that tracks sources/inputs of source files.
This could unify the notion of "sources" used for tasks and watch sources.
