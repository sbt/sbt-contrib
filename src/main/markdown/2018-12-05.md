sbt launcher script broke preloaded local rsync.

### sbt 0.13.18

Eugene has given up on publishing sbt 0.13 using JDK 1.6,
so sbt 0.13.18 is published using JDK 8.

All active development has been on sbt 1, but I would like to annouce the end of sbt 0.13 public support effective today, and April, 2019 for Lightbend subscribers. sbt 0.13.18 will likely be one of the last 0.13.x releases.

### lm Coursier

Wait and see.

### classloader

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4476

Apparently writing Analysis file is slow.

### nightly

There are currently two scripts for develop and 1.2.x.

### sbt 1.3.x
