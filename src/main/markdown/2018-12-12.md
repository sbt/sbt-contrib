## Agenda

- sbt 1.2.x
- sbt 1.3.x

### sbt 1.2.x

There's a bug in bash script, so we need sbt 1.2.8.

Akka reported unidoc no longer works because of the new doc task.

### nightly

Nightlies are working on both develop branch and 1.2.x.

### whitesource check

Whitesource validation has been failing. We need to update the token?

### sbt 1.3.x

It would be good to go back to JDK11 testing since doc task should now work.

Eugene to look into cleaning up super shell. If it is not stable, we should make it opt-in for sbt 1.3.
