```

## JDK 11

Everything is tested on JDK11 first.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4389
Scala 2.11 compiler bridge doesn't compile currently on JDK11.

## Maven dependency semantics

- strict mode
- https://github.com/cb372/sbt-explicit-dependencies
- https://github.com/tkawachi/sbt-lock
- lock file
- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2989

## sbt 1.3.x

1. JDK 11 probably.
2. Coursier lm probably too.
3. Watch / Glob situation.
4. classloader.

## Watch / Glob

Finish the PR.
Move on to documentation.

### new stylish way

1. your task uses Glob, which is `file("foo") * "*.yaml"`
2. the Glob is auto translated into Watch instance, therefore ~dockerMagical automatically watches yaml file.

### old traditionalist way

1. you add `watchSource += WatchSource("something", "*.yaml")`
2. then `~anything` will watch YAML file, including `~dockerMagical`
