## nightlies

nightlies: ok
community build caught bincompat breakage in "Disabled" object.
https://github.com/sbt/librarymanagement/pull/290 should fix it.

There is a fresh failure:

```
[02:39:28] [akka-stuff] [warn] Unexpected javac output: javadoc: error - invalid flag: --ignore-source-errors
```

## Zinc

1.3.0-M1 and 1.3.0-M2 were released mostly to test compile to JAR feature.


## sbt 1.3.x

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4524 merges latest Zinc and Util.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4514

JDK11 incremental compilation should be worked on before RC-1.
And wrapping up existing PRs.
