## Agenda

- Glob
- sbt 1.3.x
- nightlies

### Glob

For now many things would be hidden to public, by using private[sbt].
We don't want the users to create custom caches yet until the API stablizes.
Ultimately creating a custom file system might be better.

Glob stays, but TypePath would need to change to just Path.

- Remove TypePath out of the codebase.
- Implement smarter's idea of internally validating the implementation

### Timestamp resolution in Docker

Maybe the JAR file timestamp is causing this?
is `*.class` file timestamp causing this?
reducing the resolution can cause issue.

### JDK 11

Tests are now passing locally.
https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/640

### Classloader

- "flass except for /classes directory" might be a good addition.
- Maybe ignore rt.jar changes in Zinc?
