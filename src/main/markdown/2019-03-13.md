## Agenda

- What do we need for 1.3.0-M1 or -RC1
- JDK11
- Glob / cache IO
- Coursier

### JDK11

Two PRs in Zinc about JDK 11.
They are now being reviewed.

### Glob / cache IO

There are future changes planned for automatically switching between OS notifications and polling. For now, we should back out any manual configurations around watching, and hide them.

Caching should probably be turned off by default as well for sbt 1.3.0.
(Or turn it on but just to compare the results)

### Idea: Java 7 Filesystem API

Ethan: Implement filesystem.

### Coursier
