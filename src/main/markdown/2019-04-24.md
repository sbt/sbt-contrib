### compiler-bridge

Thinking about a way to query for capability, like COM's IUnknown.

### Glob

Globs can compose.

#### Basic glob API

Default API is completely English

```
Glob(baseDirectory.value)
Glob(baseDirectory.value, "bar")
Glob(baseDirectory.value, "*.txt")
Glob(baseDirectory.value, RecursiveGlob / "*.txt")
Glob(baseDirectory.value, AnyPath / "*.txt")
```

#### Glob operations

```
baseDirectory.value.toGlob / "bar"
baseDirectory.value.toGlob / **
```

#### Path (File) operations

```
file("target") %insertop% "bar/*.txt"
baseDirectory.value %insertop% ** / "*.scala"
```

We could not think of a good operator to lift path to a glob.

```
file("target") glob "bar/*.txt"
file("target").toGlob / "bar/*.txt"
```

#### NIO Path operations

```
file("target").toPath.toGlob
file("target").toPath / "bar"
```
