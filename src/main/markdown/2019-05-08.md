### Agenda



### benchmarking

Ethan's working on benchmarking.
That exposed some bugs.

Swoval has a bug on JDK11 on Windows.

There's a bug in `~` cache invalidation of stamps.
There should be a setting to not use cache.

### Glob

File filers are pain.
File filter can do anything, so it doesn't map one-on-one with glob.
PathFinder probably should be on its own.

### cached package

Package task uses Mapping.


```scala
foo / changeFiles
```

is automatically injected.
See nio/make-clone.

### launcher

launcher's classpath leaks.
There should be an issue for me.
