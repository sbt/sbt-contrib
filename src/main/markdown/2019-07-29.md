## agenda

- sbt 1.3.0-RC4


### resource loading via ClassLoader

Resource ClassLoader had a bug that invalidated classloader too frequently.

### parser perf issue

semicolon parser had optional space, which caused insane backtracking.


### Zinc issue

Analysis files that are not in sync. It restamps everything.
This causes undercompilation.

Source uses content hash. The content hashing should be replaced with a faster one.

### incremental task

We'll take out previous, and use tracked etc.
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/4900

### tracked documentation

Add documentation for util tracked.
