## loading optimization

settings are O(n) against the number of subprojects

### strategy 1: Persist setting values

### strategy 2: make settings lazy

### related idea

## sbt 1.4.0-M1

### lint stuff


### sbt server extensibility

Is it good idea to add Extracted?
Maybe we create a new Extracted that's better named and described?

## Swoval

Ethan is looking into in-sourcing Swoval to be part of sbt family.
