## agenda

- supershell
- standard in/out
- test
- launcher

### supershell

Ethan brought up supershell. Specifically about the summary region being variable. He suggested potentially displaying only top-n long running tasks.

Eugene thought it might compromise the usefulness of supershell if it displayed partial data. Maybe putting a minimum threashold for supershell to kick in so tasks like `clean` won't trigger it?

### standard in/out + sbt new issue

sbt new issue is likely due to terminal being "initialized" to no echo.

Ethan is working on redirection of standard in. This would be a thread that's blocking for standard in. Eugene noted to check sbt-pgp and InteractionService:

### test

Eugene brought up the idea of registering a hook (a command?) before and after `test` across all subprojects. This could be used for example to close all test classloaders at the same time after all tests are done.

#### Metaspace

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4166 still holds it seems.

### launcher

Discussed pure Java launcher and getting rid of ProGuard.
Ethan says we still need layered ClassLoader to vacate out Scala library etc.
