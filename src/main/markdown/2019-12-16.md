### sbt 1.3.5

Eugene released sbt 1.3.5 on Friday.
https://discuss.lightbend.com/t/annouce-sbt-1-3-5/5605
The backports turned out not to be so stable, resulting in regressions.

#### ScalaTest layer

The aimed gain was a workaround for ScalaTest failing to load resource caused by closed ClassLoader. In addition tests would load 250ms faster (like turbo mode's layered ClassLoader).

In reality, this turned out to cause multiple reports of NoClassDefFoundError because ScalaTest loads all sorts of other libraries, and also class loading is hard.

#### cross +

We should add unit tests.

### sbt 1.3.6

Let's revert ScalaTest layer https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5273
Set classloader close to false.

### other ideas

GC warning

### supershell fix

Ethan demoed his stdout virtualization work.
It works with println by virtualizing stdout.
This could pave the way for thin-client doing things like `run` and `console` that currently output to terminal directly.

### watch reimplented as a CommandExchange client

This could make watch background.
`~console`
