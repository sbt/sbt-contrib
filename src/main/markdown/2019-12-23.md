Ethan demoed thin client built using Graal Native image.

## Play watcher

Could Play migrate to sbt watcher?

Play's `run` is always watching sources, and it rebuilds when it gets a new request.

In Lagom, if source changes it automatically builds in the background. Play would like that too.

Some relevant classes might be:

- sbt/nio package - https://github.com/sbt/io/tree/develop/io/src/main/scala/sbt/nio
- Glob - https://github.com/sbt/io/blob/develop/io/src/main/scala/sbt/nio/file/Glob.scala
- FileTreeRepository
- EventMonitor

Currently a bunch of things are in `private[sbt]` but watching has stablized to make things public.

### Glob

```
sealed trait Glob {

  /**
   * Indicates whether a path matches the pattern specified by this [[Glob]].
   *
   * @param path the path to match
   * @return true it the path matches.
   */
  def matches(path: Path): Boolean
}
```
