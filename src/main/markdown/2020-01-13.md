## agenda

- Scala Center prosal on BSP
- Ethan terminal
- scripted
- Zinc


## BSP support

https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/pull/56

Justin: It would make IntelliJ import smoother.
Eugene: sbt server uses domain socket.
Ethan: Terminal virtualization might be related here.

There's a PR to extend sbt server - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5207

## Ethan's terminal

Majority of the feature is working with thin client.
There's a logistical cha]lenge in rolling this out.
1. we have to fork JLine.
2. how to run and distribute sbt.
   - Ethan created a new entry point Java app (Graal native image)
   - if there's a server instance, it will connect to the server
   - if there is no server, it will start a new sbt by shelling out to Bash
   - We should automate the release

Instead of shell/batch files we should try to encode everything using pure Java.
Bash file may remain but it would become java -jar with 50MB.

In working with scripted, Ethan re-implemented new launching mechanism.
This makes him think he might be able to re-implement launcher using pure Java too.

## Scripted

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5367

## Zinc

Eugene working on virtualizing source input.
The change he's making might result to Zinc 2.0.
At which point, it might make sense to in-source IO and Util usages.

## PR reviews

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5364 is effectively a single line PR:

```
  private[sbt] def makeIvyXmlBefore[T](
```

but with duplicated code. We should put that in 1.3.x and release 1.3.7 soon instead.

Add https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5350 and https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/5353 to backport candidate.
