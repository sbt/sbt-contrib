- sbt 1.3.8

- Zinc
- launcher

## linux and Windows package automation



## sbt 1.3.8

IO 1.3.3 took 24h to sync.

## style guide message

We should unify towards lowercase.
`Compiling 10 Scala sources to /full/path/` doesn't make sense.
Eugene wants to make `Loading` lowercase.

## Zinc

Starting to build sbt and Zinc virtual file branch together.


## launcher

Ethan is working on thin client. He's looking into using native image.

sbtw (coursier launcher)
- resolution

sbtw
- command line parsing

"thin client"
- is this app the same

"server"
- traditional sbt core artifacts

How long does it take to create native image?
It takes 2 minutes on Ethan's machine.

Eugene: We need to maintain compatibility with sbt launcher-interface, including repositories override.
