## preloaded local

Dale and I discussed https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/5414.

Back in sbt 0.13, the out-of-box install experience was slow especially in Australia or in hotel wifi situation. Preloaded local repo came out of the "getting started" improvement initiative at the time, by resurrecting the idea of offline installation which Typesafe Activator had.

It's fair to reevaluate the complextity tradeoff of preloaded local now that sbt 1.x is published to Maven Central, and hopefully eventually we can also use Coursier for all three layers (launcher, sbt plugins, and proper build).

Eugene thinks there's still a value in being able to install sbt offline, either in production environment or behind-the-proxy development environment.

Dale pointed out that in most cases the particular version of sbt installer would not match the `project/build.properties` file.

One of the short-term fix might be doing a sanity check on the preloaded to see if the sbt.jar for the requested sbt version (in this case sbt 1.2.8) exists, and if not evict the resolver from the resolution.
