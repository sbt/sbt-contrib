### 1.4.0-M2

Let's get something out this week.

### pipelining

- Dale todo: not all Scala pickles are available
- todo: pipelining works in sbt/sbt
- "set ThisBuild / usePipelining" doesn't work?
- should we surface compile to JAR to sbt?

### thin client

1. we'd need to pick a name for the programs. (it won't fork for sbt 1.3.x builds)
2. documentation of some sort on sbt/website
3. upload to Maven Central
4. character reading thread race condition

### other issues

- Eugene: fix ; parsing issue?
- Ethan: persisting UpdateReport, and tracking derivatible tasks by hash
- Scala 2.12.12. should we hold off on this?
